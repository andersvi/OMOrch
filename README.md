# OMOrch

Yet-Another-OM-Orchxx-lib!  (YAOMO!)

An OpenMusic-lib to call and use output from Carmine-Emanuele Cella
"Orchidea" orchestration tool: https://http://www.orch-idea.org/

Inspired by "OM-Orchidea" by Geof Holbrook and "OM-Orchidee" by Jean
Bresson.

**Installation**

Unpack the compressed library, and move it to a place where OM looks
for libraries (set in your Preferences).  You will probably need to
rename the extracted folder - OMOrch-v.xx to just OMOrch.

The lib currently relies on a CLI-version of 'orchestrate' from
Carmine's Orchidea-software.

A precompiled version for Linux is included inside the 'resources/'
folder (together with the other cli-tools used by Orchidea)

**SOL database**

You will also need a compatible sample-dataset to work with Orchidea,
fex.  "FullSOL" or "TinySOL":

**Tutorials**

Tutorials are available at the usual place after the lib is loaded:
"Help->Import Tutorial Patches->Libraries->OMOrch".

**Development**

Sources are available at https://github.com/andersvi/OMOrch

OMOrch is very much under development, and has a rather large
TODO-list.  If you discover bugs or have suggestions or good
solutions, please set up a note at the "Discussions" tab at the
git-repo:

  https://github.com/andersvi/OMOrch/discussions

When reporting bugs please try to provide a precise step-by-step
explanation together with a MWE: an empty new workspace containing
only the necessary patches and resources to trigger the bug.
