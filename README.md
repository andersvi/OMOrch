# OMOrch

Yet-Another-OM-Orchxx-lib!  (YAOMO!)

Inspired by "OM-Orchidea" by Geof Holbrook and "OM-Orchidee" by Jean
Bresson.

An OpenMusic-lib to call and use output from Carmine-Emanuele Cella
"Orchidea" orchestration tool: https://http://www.orch-idea.org/

This lib isn't very useful unless you have installed the CLI-version
of Carmine's Orchidea-software.

You will also need a compatible sample-dataset to work with Orchidea,
fex.  "FullSOL" or "TinySOL":

OMOrch is very much under development, has a rather large TODO-list.
I'd be happy if you contact me (anders@avinjar.no) if you find bugs,
have suggestions or good solutions.

When reporting bugs it is very helpful if you can provide a precise
step-by-step explanation together with a MWE: an empty new workspace
containing only the necessary patches, files and folders to show the
bug, and nothing else.
